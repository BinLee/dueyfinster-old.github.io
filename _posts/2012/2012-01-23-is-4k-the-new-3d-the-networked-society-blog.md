Good insights from CES: <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/thinkingahead/the-networked-society-blog/2012/01/18/is-4k-the-new-3d/">Is 4K the new 3D? - The Networked Society Blog</a>.

I'd love to own a 4K screen, the more lifelike the images the better it'll be for movies. I'd imagine filesizes are 4x as large as HD also, which will be an issue that might kill off optical storage (and require better broadband). It's a shame the author tried to compare it to 3D (which objectively is still a flop) but he mentions the issues in that technology (namely: field of vision).
