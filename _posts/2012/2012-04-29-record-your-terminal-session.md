As I've mentioned before[^1], I regularly watch technology podcasts and I've had a subscription to sites like [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com "Lynda Training Videos"). Between those and Youtube, I've watched an awful lot of technology how-to videos and 90% of them are quite poor in terms of editing, sound and being coherent/properly scripted. Sometimes though it's a joy to genuinely learn something new in a short, concise and to the point video.

This haktip is right up there with being among the best: short, concise, to the point and about a utility that will be super-useful to me. In work I'm in an agile software development team and I spend a lot of time on the command line. I **like** the command line, but many don't (personal preference I guess). As part of being agile, we produce a lot of video demos to stakeholders. Increasingly though the demos we produce are just as useful for the team - you can't be every team member at once and this provides huge visibility to the team of progress. Our software is a Unix product, but we develop on Windows - so Camtasia is usually used - which is fine for GUI[^2] demos. This handy utility will be great to demo CLI[^3] stuff we do.
